# Polar Stream Mini

Standalone one-device Polar H10 BLE-to-LSL applet. The UI is intentionally a
compact transparent-shell window with its own install, settings, and process.

- Default outputs: raw ECG, raw accelerometer, heart rate, and RR intervals.
- Optional outputs: Polar metrics including Excite-O-Meter, PCA ACC breathing
  waveform/phase and dynamics, Phan events/rate, and Flowborne phase/score.
  See [`docs/acc-breathing-methods.md`](../../docs/acc-breathing-methods.md).
- Checking a realtime metric saves it as a default for future launches and
  applies it to the active LSL output. **Reset metrics** clears all optional
  selections while keeping raw ECG, ACC, heart rate, and RR.
- Modes: canonical separate LSL streams or one sparse fixed-channel LSL stream.
- For exact ECG/ACC sample timing, use separate streams. The single sparse mode
  preserves acquisition order and clamps overlapping channel timestamps to the
  next microsecond; it does not add full sample periods or drift into the future.
- Changing mode, stream name, or optional metrics replaces active LSL outlets
  without disconnecting the H10 or pausing its sample worker. If replacement
  fails, the previous healthy outlets continue publishing.
- Startup: opt-in **Start with PC** registration plus default automatic
  reconnection to the last successfully connected H10.
- Memory: app-local stream name, output mode, reconnect preference, selected
  metrics, and last H10.
- Multi-device use: launch multiple app instances.
- Mocking: **Mock** launches an independent, automatically streaming applet.
  Its 130 Hz ECG replays a bundled, 60-minute NeuroKit2 ECGSYN recording and
  loops after one hour. ACC (200 Hz), HR/RR, and derived metrics remain
  synthetic. All mock outputs use real LSL publication; its PID-suffixed
  stream name and settings are session-only. Regenerate the ECG fixture with
  `python scripts/generate_polar_mini_mock_ecg.py` and NeuroKit2 0.2.13.
- Without a connected H10, the regular app does not publish invented sensor
  measurements; use the clearly labeled Mock window for synthetic data.
- Live state: after samples are flowing through a healthy LSL outlet, the three
  outline rings emit a restrained breathing beacon; connected-only state does
  not animate.
- Logo: `icons/app-icon.svg`, preserving the original Polar Stream geometry and
  changing only its palette to Polar red, black, and white.
